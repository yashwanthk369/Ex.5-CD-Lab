# RECOGNITION OF THE GRAMMAR(a^nb where n>=10) USING YACC
## Register Number:
## Date:
## AIM:
To write a YACC program to recognize the grammar a^nb where n>=10.
## ALGORITHM:
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the variables a and b.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc –d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter a string as input and it is identified as valid or invalid.
## PROGRAM:
## OUTPUT:
## RESULT:
The YACC program to recognize the grammar anb where n>=10 is executed successfully and the output is verified.
